We have discovered that the upper echelon of Butcher Corp. uses a temporary token generator along with their brain chips as a form of 2FA(Two-Factor Authentication) for their most restricted systems. Our intel team got their source code, but we still haven't got the seed right. We need you to get it for us, as we're sure it will be useful for other systems! The name of one of this system's users is "**Dúfa van Tryggvadóttir**", vice president of the company.
