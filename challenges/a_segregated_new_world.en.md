This letter is being broadcasted to all hackers in the world, from the group **Rebellious Fingers**. Read it with care, the situation is chaotic, and we need your help!

In 2027, what we now call "**The Order**", also known as "**The Bavarian**", came to be. They're a select group of men working as a hidden branch of the OCU (United Countries Organization). The "**bavs**", as their members are called, are high-ranked officers of the government in developed countries, leaders of multinational companies in many fields of activity, like food, automotive and pharmaceutic industry, scientists and hackers. They usually gather annually in a place called **Berg's Club**, but we haven't found its location yet.

We know one of its leaders is called Wilson, a person that has become extremely obsessed with their projects, and he plans on making use of the "bavs" to carry out two of his greatest objectives, the implantation of a globally unified government, and the reduction of the global population to an order of around 1 billion people, before the end of this century. In order to reach the second objective, they are creating a virus called **H1N337**, projected to sterilize 80% of the population in the world, making the birth rate plummet, in relation to the mortality rate. Another person in charge is known only as Mr. Deadcow, but we don't have his name. We suspect he uses this name because of his involvement with the creation of the infectious agent of the Mad Cow disease, while working for the american government in the 80s, and moving on to the United Kingdom as his "testing laboratory".

We have found the propagation of the H1N337 will happen in basically 3 ways:

**1** - through food, from companies like Kraftsico, present in various countries;

**2** - through air, from exhausting pipes of some brands like Wolkslet containing the virus, which will be released in a specific moment, according to their programming;

**3** - through drugs, from many pharmaceutical companies like Valeanton (famous for heavily overpricing medicine in a global scale).

This entire operation was planned to be very stealthy! The engineers of Wolkslet, for one, created an "electronic cheating device", called "toxiclean", which is extremely effective in avoiding the tests of air pollutant emissions, and does not release the virus when it detects it is inside a test environment. This virus is strongly resistant to heat, so the high temperatures of exhausting pipes does no harm to its structure at the time of release.

We must be very careful with our identities, as the method of work of The Bavarian is extremely sadistic, with murder and tortures being present whenever they can (they are the shoot first, ask questions later kind of people). They have access to national healthcare bases in many different countries, and are able to change people's medical records to cover their murders, making them look like suicide or illness. They can also access general SmarTVs and IoT devices like routers, through backdoors, in order to sniff traffic, or public cameras of various brands in different countries, such as the street ones, for spionage. Using advanced facial recognition technologies in such cameras they can find their opponents almost anywhere. They can also track people by other means, such as:

**1** - gathering bank transactions (including ATMs);

**2** - through telephone networks;

**3** - through apparently "safe" message applications, with end-to-end cryptography.

For the global government plan, the first step taken will be to elect their candidates in the main countries where the "bavs" haven't taken control yet. For this task, they will fraud the elections using the electronic voting machines made by the Dieitalic company, which are not auditable. The idea of adopting an unique and centralized criptocurrency is also being worked on, and they're going to call it globalcoin.

A model of digital lock is being produced by a company of the Order called RayHeed, and their ambition is to begin installing it in the houses of every country already controlled by "bavs", by using some artificial gadget to induce civilians into doing it. We still don't know their objective in doing so, but we'll try to infiltrate their next annual meeting at Berg's Club, after we find out its location, as matters of this kind aren't discussed through e-mails or other means of communication we can try to get access to. Between all 7 levels of security in which their files, conversations and other intel is categorized, this one is ranked the highest, called SS7.

That being said, we have the complex mission of stopping the most structured and dangerous group we have ever come across, reply with ```CTF-BR{I_know_about_th3_r1sks!}```, if you're willing to put your life on the line to give the human race a chance to keep on existing by joining the Rebellious Fingers!
