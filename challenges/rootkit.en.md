We have reasons to believe that one of our servers has been owned by Bloodsuckers Intelligence. It seems that they have installed a **binary rootkit** in our system, in order to obtain our credentials and get acess to our other servers. Do some forensic analysis in our system dump, and reverse engineer the vulnerability that you find in order to get the password to access the credentials sniffer. After that, understanding how the rootkit works, recover the last valid password used by the root in our server, because the Intel team might have changed it to one of their defaults, which might come in handy when we try to access their systems, like the dump one!

Submit the flag in the format '**CTF-BR{PasswordUsedInDump, LastValidRootPassword}**'

**Note:** We don't have the credentials, that's part of the challenge.
