Case was walking around the corporation when he came across an "electrified labyrinth". At this moment he heard a noise behind him and, without thinking, jumped into the labyrinth. Just as he stepped inside, the wall closed, leaving him trapped. It was a trap. On the wall beside him, there was a map of the labyrinth with instructions:

This labyrinth is electrified. This map indicates the electrical resistance in each path connecting two rooms. If you come alive on the other side, we are waiting for your punishment. In 10 minutes the electricity will be turned on. You have only one chance to get out of it alive (and find us on the other side).

Case, not too worried about what he was going to do when he got to the other side, he thought quickly. The least dangerous path is the one with the smallest current. Despite being an approximation, Case thought it would be worth risking on the road with the least resistance being the greatest possible, after all did not have much time to think about a better strategy.

In the security room the board of directors was watching the day's attraction and cheering for Case (to torture him when he defeated the labyrinth). Months earlier, when they planned this labyrinth, planning it, they needed a programmer to determine which way a person should go to get out of a point of origin and reach a destination point using the strategy that Case thought (the strategy was correct).

Case, very clever, in addition to being able to leave the labyrinth and escape the torture, still took the map of the labyrinth. You are now responsible for, given the map, proposing the safest route between the requested rooms.

The input consists of several lines containing two strings and a number (A B R) describing the map, indicating that the electrical resistance between A and B is R. After the map is informed, there are lines containing only two characters each line. For each one of them you must respond with a line with the smallest resistance that Case will need to cross with one decimal place.

Example:

input:

1 2 10

2 3 10

1 3 1

1 2

2 3

1 3

output:

10.0

10.0

10.0
